# Creating Synthesizer Plug-Ins with C++ and JUCE

Contains my work as I progress through Matthijs Hollemans'
[_Creating Synthesizer Plug-Ins with C++ and JUCE_](https://www.theaudioprogrammer.com/books/synth-plugin-book).
This project is creating a replica of the
[JX10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_JX-10) synthesizer using the
[JUCE](https://juce.com/) framework.

The end result will be a synthesizer plugin, able to be used with any DAW.
Becuase this synth is a digital evolution of the JX10, Hollemans names this
synthesizer _JX11_.
